# BI API

The BI API powers the BI Web, as well as BrAPI powered applications.

The API is built using Java 12 and the Micronaut framework.  The development guide for Micronaut can be found at: https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html

## Development Guide

### Prerequisites

1. Java 12 SDK installed
1. Maven installed (or via IDE)

### Project setup

```
mvn clean install
```

#### Get latest micronaut-security code

Micronaut-security 1.2.2 has a bug in the JWT validation code so the latest code from github must be used to fix this problem.

```
git clone https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-security.git
```

Build micronaut-security using:

```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

If using IntelliJ, press Ctrl+Shift+A to open actions and type reimport to find the option to reimport all maven projects. (note: on a Mac thatâ€™s Command-Shift-A; it opens a Search window that has an option for Actions, but is not labeled as an Actions pane). Execute a maven run configuration that does a clean install.

### Developer config

In `src/main/resources/`, make a copy of `application-prod.yml` as `application-dev.yml` (this file is ignored from git) and replace placeholder values.  If you need to override any value that's in `application.yml`, you can do so by specifying the identical structure in your `application-dev.yml` file.

### Create the database

Run this docker command in terminal to start up a postgres docker container with the empty bi_db database in it. 

```
docker container run --name bidb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=bidb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:11.4
```

You will need to create your user in the database table in order to log in successfully. Under resources/db/migration open the V0.11_create-users.sql file and add another insert line for your user. Alternatively, you can execute the same sql insert statement in the sql executor of your choice. 

```
insert into bi_user (orcid, name) values ('xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx', '<name>');
```

Flyway will run when you run your bi-api project for the first time. Alternatively, you can run flyway through Maven. 

```
mvn flyway:migrate -X
```

The database with your user data will persist until the docker container is stopped. But, saving your username in the V0.11__create-users.sql file will create your user again when the project is run. 

#### Updating Database

If you have run the project and the database once already, you will need to clear your database with the flyway java module and recreate it. 

```
mvn flyway:clean -X
mvn flyway:migrate -X
```

### Run the app

If running in an IDE (like IntelliJ):

- Create an application run config with the main class being `org.breedinginsight.api.Application`
- Pass VM options of: `--enable-preview --illegal-access=warn -Dmicronaut.environments=dev`

If running as a packaged JAR:
```
java --enable-preview -Dmicronaut.environments=dev -jar bi-api*.jar
```
