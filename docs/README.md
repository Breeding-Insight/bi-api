# Breeding Insight API Documentation

The API documentation is written using the OpenAPI yaml specification and easily navigable documentation set is generated from that. The yaml file should only be changed in this repository and then pushed up to SwaggerHub after changes have been approved.

## Editing the YAML specification

The Swagger Editor is the easiest way to edit the file and see the genereated documentation as you work. It can be run locally as outlined on the [Swagged Editor Github](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor) or you can use a [hosted version](https://editor.swagger.io/). You will just need to import and export the yaml file.
